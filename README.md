## CODING-QUIZ

This project was designed as a homework assignment for OSU's Bootcamp Course.

My quiz application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript for its framework and functionality. This application highlights the implementation of Javascript to provide quiz questions and provides functionality to determine whether the answers to a question are correct or wrong. At the end of the quiz will display GAME OVER and your high score based on the amount of questions you got right and the time remaining on the timer. You can then enter your initials and select the play again button to start over. 

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To play the coding quiz click on the deployment link to get started.
